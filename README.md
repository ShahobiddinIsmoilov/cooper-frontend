# Diagonal.uz - Internetning Bosh Sahifasi
It is really difficult to find valuable information in Uzbek language on the Internet. If a question comes to mind, almost all the time we have no choice but to search the answer in Russian or English. Especially if the question is specific to, let's say, one of Uzbekistan's regions, or particular field, we almost never find anything valuable. I believe one of the reasons for this is the fact that there is no local platform in which anyone can post information, questions, news, etc. and anyone can comment. Telegram channels and groups work for most purposes, but it's designed in a way that only admins or selected individuals can create posts. Also, Telegram comments are hard to follow, so it's hard to make any meaning from the conversation. I had an intention to make a platform where anyone can post and comment for a while now, and finally, I can say I have a working platform.
